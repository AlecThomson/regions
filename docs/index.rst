#############################

This is an astropy-affiliated package for region handling. The goal is to merge
the functionality in astropy/`pyregion`_ and astropy/`photutils`_/aperture.
After a test phase of a few week this package should be moved to astropy core. This
`PyAstro16 doc`_ contains some more information about the discussions that started
this package.

* Code : `Github repository`_
* Docs : `Region documentation`_
