What next?
==========

Congratulations, you have made it to the end of the tutorial getting started guide of the
``regions`` package.

For detailed information on some specific functionality, see the API documentation here: `regions`.
Be warned though that a lot of methods haven't been implemented yet.
If you try them, they will raise a ``NotImplementedError``.

If you have the skills and time, please head over to
https://github.com/astropy/regions
and help out with ``regions`` development.
Of course, feature requests are also welcome ... they help us prioritize development efforts.
